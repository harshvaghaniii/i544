Problem because gradescope makes copies of
/autograder/source/{setup.sh,run_autograder} into /autograder.


This directory serves as the local analog of gradescope's /autograder
directory.

We do not run setup.sh or run_autograder locally.  Instead, we
will run source/do-autograde.sh from this directory.
