This solution has the following changes from that required for
Project 3 as assigned:

  # It implements a new *Get-Lendings* web-service at `GET
    /BASE/lending` with required query parameter `findBy` of type
    'isbn' | patronId'.  If `findBy` has value `isbn`, then the
    additional `isbn` parameter must be specified.  If `findBy` has
    value `patronId`, then the additional `patronId` parameter must be
    specificied.

    This change requires the use of a new version of 0.1.1 of
    lending-library to with an additional `getLendings()` method to
    support this new web-service.

  # All hrefs in responses are returned as absolute URLs (contain the
    protocol/server/port).

  # The `DELETE` method was added to the list of allowed CORS methods.


Note that because of the second change, the `LOG` provided when the
project was assigned will no longer match.
